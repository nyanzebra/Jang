## Goals
- [ ] networking setup (udp and tcp)
- [ ] graphics (textures, shaders, algorithms, windows, scenes, meshes, models, rays, simplex clouds, renderers, cameras, etc)
- [ ] container base
- [ ] policy allocators
- [ ] configuration options
- [ ] logging (both locally and on hosted network)
- [ ] filesystem (able to manage all that will be in c++17)
- [ ] memory management tracker
- [ ] extended types and definitions
- [ ] more containers (trie, graph, skip list, JSON, LRU cache, other trees..., etc)
- [ ] file class to access c-style file modifiers
- [ ] stream base that leads to networking as well

- [ ] test framework
- [ ] console wrapper
- [ ] pattern stubs (observer, factory, etc...)
- [ ] more exceptions
- [ ] clear naming
- [ ] more math (calculus)
- [ ] basic emulator parts (accumulator, registers, pipeline, assembly parsing)
- [ ] more algorithms
- [ ] more parallelism
- [ ] more type traits
- [ ] lisp compiler?
- [ ] u8 support strings?
- [ ] c++17 features
- [ ] more sensical placements of classes and functions
- [ ] AI?
- [ ] machine learning?
- [ ] event system
